# Global Cancer Data Analysis (2015–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive healthcare analytics study on global cancer patient data collected between 2015 and 2024. The analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical hypothesis testing, and machine learning techniques to understand cancer demographics, severity drivers, early-stage diagnosis patterns, survival outcomes, and treatment cost variations.

The goal of this project is to derive data-driven insights that can support early detection strategies, preventive healthcare planning, and informed policy decisions.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Cancer affects multiple age groups, not only the elderly  
- Smoking, genetic risk, and environmental factors are major contributors to cancer severity  
- Early-stage diagnosis rates range between 38% and 41% across cancer types  
- Lung cancer shows relatively lower early detection rates  
- Treatment cost does not guarantee longer survival  
- Cancer severity can be modeled, but survival prediction requires richer clinical data  

---

## 🏥 Healthcare & Business Implications
- Supports targeted screening and early detection strategies  
- Highlights the importance of reducing modifiable risk factors such as smoking  
- Reveals global disparities in treatment costs  
- Emphasizes the need for data-driven healthcare policy planning  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Survival analysis using Cox Proportional Hazards models  
- Deep learning approaches for outcome prediction  
- Integration of treatment response and genomic data  
- Cost-effectiveness and healthcare policy impact studies

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data science, statistics, and machine learning to real-world healthcare data. While cancer severity can be partially explained using demographic and lifestyle factors, survival outcomes depend on deeper clinical variables, highlighting important directions for future research.
